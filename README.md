# DigitRecognition
Created a Dense neural-network framework using python and Numpy.
Using supervised training and backpropagation, train the model on the MNIST Database.
Using python sockets and threading, deploy the model onto a server instance in order to allow 
multiple user interaction.
PyGame GUI is provided so the users can give input to the model in terms of hand-written digits
for model classification purposes.
